- **Fast development**
- **Highly reliable programs**

Unlike many languages, Go focuses on **clarity over complexity**.

---

## 🧬 Programming Paradigms Supported

- Procedural Programming
- Concurrent Programming
- Modular Programming

(Go intentionally avoids full OOP complexity — but supports struct-based design.)

---

## 📚 What You Will Learn

---

## 🔰 Module 1: Getting Started

- Installing Go
- GOPATH & Workspace
- Running Programs

### Hello World
\`\`\`go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello Go!")
}
\`\`\`

---

## ✨ Module 2: Variables & Data Types

### Declaring Variables
\`\`\`go
var name string = "CodeZen"
age := 21
\`\`\`

### Data Types
- int
- float32 / float64
- string
- bool

---

## ➗ Module 3: Operators
- Arithmetic
- Comparison
- Logical
- Assignment

---

## 🧩 Module 4: Control Flow

### If / Else
\`\`\`go
age := 18

if age >= 18 {
  fmt.Println("Adult")
} else {
  fmt.Println("Minor")
}
\`\`\`

### Switch
\`\`\`go
switch day := 2; day {
 case 1: fmt.Println("Mon")
 case 2: fmt.Println("Tue")
 default: fmt.Println("Other")
}
\`\`\`

---

## 🔁 Module 5: Loops
Go only has one loop → **for**

### Example
\`\`\`go
for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
  fmt.Println(i)
}
\`\`\`

---

    notes: `# Rust Programming Fundamentals

## 🦀 Introduction to Rust

Rust is a **high-performance, memory-safe, and modern programming language** created by Mozilla. It is designed to provide **C/C++ level speed** while preventing memory errors, crashes, and security vulnerabilities.

Rust is massively popular in:

- System Programming
- WebAssembly
- Game Engines
- Blockchain
- Cloud Infrastructure
- Performance-Critical Applications

Rust gives you **speed, safety, and concurrency — without garbage collection**.

---

## 🌟 Why Learn Rust?

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🛡 **Memory Safe** | Prevents crashes, null pointers & data races |
| ⚡ **Super Fast** | Comparable to C/C++ |
| 🔀 **Fearless Concurrency** | Safe multithreading |
| 🧠 **Modern Design** | Powerful features and clean syntax |
| 🚀 **High Demand** | Loved & highly paid language |
| 🏆 **Most Loved Language** | Frequently #1 on StackOverflow |

---

## 🧠 Rust Philosophy

Rust focuses on:

- **Safety**
- **Speed**
- **Concurrency**
- **Zero-cost abstractions**
- **No garbage collector**
- **No runtime overhead**

Rust makes you write **correct and efficient code** from the beginning.

---

## 📚 What You Will Learn

---

## 🔰 Module 1: Getting Started

- Install Rust using rustup
- cargo (Rust’s build system)
- Running programs

### Hello Rust
\`\`\`rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello Rust!");
}
\`\`\`

---

## ✨ Module 2: Variables & Data Types

### Variables
\`\`\`rust
let name = "CodeZen";
let mut age = 21;
\`\`\`

\`let\` → immutable by default  
\`mut\` → makes variable changeable

### Data Types
- i32, i64
- f32, f64
- bool
- char
- String

---

## ➗ Module 3: Operators
- Arithmetic
- Comparison
- Logical
- Assignment

---

## 🧩 Module 4: Control Flow

### If / Else
\`\`\`rust
let marks = 85;

if marks >= 90 {
    println!("Excellent");
} else {
    println!("Good");
}
\`\`\`

### Match (Rust Switch)
\`\`\`rust
let day = 2;

match day {
    1 => println!("Mon"),
    2 => println!("Tue"),
    _ => println!("Other"),
}
\`\`\`

---

## 🔁 Module 5: Loops

### Loop
\`\`\`rust
loop {
    println!("Running");
    break;
}
\`\`\`

### While
\`\`\`rust
let mut x = 1;
while x <= 5 {
    println!("{}", x);
    x += 1;
}
\`\`\`

### For
\`\`\`rust
for i in 1..6 {
    println!("{}", i);
}
\`\`\`

---

## 📦 Module 6: Ownership — Rust’s Superpower

Rust prevents memory bugs using **Ownership Rules**:

1️⃣ Each value has one owner  
2️⃣ When owner goes out of scope, value is freed  
3️⃣ You cannot use data after move

Example:
\`\`\`rust
let s1 = String::from("Hello");
let s2 = s1; // ownership moved
\`\`\`

---

## 🧠 Borrowing & References

Rust allows safe sharing:

\`\`\`rust
let s = String::from("Rust");
let len = calculate_length(&s);

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
\`\`\`

No null.
No dangling pointers.
No memory leaks.

---

## 🧑‍🔧 Module 7: Functions

\`\`\`rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
\`\`\`

Supports:
- Parameters
- Return values
- Expression-based returns

---

## 🏛 Module 8: Structs & Enums

### Struct
\`\`\`rust
struct Student {
    name: String,
    age: i32,
}
\`\`\`

### Enum
\`\`\`rust
enum Role {
    Admin,
    User,
}
\`\`\`

---

## ⚙ Module 9: Error Handling

Rust has **no exceptions**.
Instead uses:

- Result
- Option

\`\`\`rust
fn divide(a: i32, b: i32) -> Option<i32> {
    if b == 0 {
        None
    } else {
        Some(a / b)
    }
}
\`\`\`

---

## 🧠 How SQL Works

SQL works with **tables** (rows and columns).

- Rows → Records
- Columns → Fields

Example table:
Users(id, name, email)

---

## 📚 What You Will Learn

---

## 🔰 Module 1: Database Basics

- What is a database?
- Relational databases

- Primary keys

---

## 📋 Module 2: Creating Tables

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);
\`\`\`

---

## 🔍 Module 3: SELECT Queries

\`\`\`sql
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT name, email FROM users;
\`\`\`

- WHERE
- ORDER BY
- LIMIT

\`\`\`sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
\`\`\`

---

## ✍ Module 4: INSERT Data

\`\`\`sql
INSERT INTO users (id, name, email)
VALUES (1, 'Alex', 'alex@mail.com');
\`\`\`

---

## 🔄 Module 5: UPDATE Data

\`\`\`sql
UPDATE users
SET email = 'new@mail.com'
WHERE id = 1;

    notes: `# Git & Version Control Essentials

## 🔧 Introduction to Git

Git is a **distributed version control system** that helps developers **track changes in code**, collaborate with teams, and manage project history efficiently. Created by Linus Torvalds, Git is the backbone of modern software development.

Git is used everywhere:
- Open-source projects
- Company codebases
- Solo projects
- Large distributed teams

Git + GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket = Modern Collaboration.

## 🌟 Why Learn Git?

| Feature | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🕒 Version History | Track every change |
| 🤝 Team Collaboration | Multiple developers, same code |
| 🔄 Easy Rollbacks | Revert mistakes safely |
| 🌍 Industry Standard | Used by all tech companies |
| 🚀 Faster Development | Parallel feature work |

---

## 🧠 What Git Solves

- Accidentally deleting code
- Overwriting teammate’s work
- Managing multiple features
- Tracking who changed what
- Maintaining stable releases

---

## 📚 What You Will Learn

---

## 🔰 Module 1: Getting Started with Git

- What is Version Control?
- Centralized vs Distributed VCS
- Installing Git
- Git configuration

\`\`\`bash
git --version
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@email.com"
\`\`\`

---

## 📁 Module 2: Git Repository Basics

- git init
- git status
- git add
- git commit

\`\`\`bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
\`\`\`

---

## 📦 Module 3: Tracking Changes

- Working directory
- Staging area
- Repository

\`\`\`bash
git status
git diff
git log
\`\`\`

---

## 🔁 Module 4: Branching

Branches allow parallel development.

\`\`\`bash
git branch feature-login
git checkout feature-login
\`\`\`

Why branches?
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Experiments

---

## 🔀 Module 5: Merging Branches

\`\`\`bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-login
\`\`\`

Types:
- Fast-forward
- Three-way merge

---

## ⚔ Module 6: Merge Conflicts

When Git can’t auto-merge changes.

Steps:
1. Open conflict file
2. Resolve manually
3. Add & commit

\`\`\`bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve conflict"
\`\`\`

---

## 🌐 Module 7: Remote Repositories

Work with GitHub/GitLab.

\`\`\`bash
git remote add origin URL
git push -u origin main
git pull origin main
\`\`\`

---

## 🔄 Module 8: Undoing Changes

- git checkout
- git reset
- git revert

\`\`\`bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
\`\`\`

---

## 🏷 Module 9: Tags & Releases

\`\`\`bash
git tag v1.0
git push origin v1.0
\`\`\`

Used for:
- Releases
- Stable versions

---

## 🚀 Real-World Applications

### 👨‍💻 Development Teams
- Feature-based workflows
- Code reviews

### 🌍 Open Source
- Forks & pull requests

### 🏗 CI/CD
- Automated builds
- Deployment pipelines
